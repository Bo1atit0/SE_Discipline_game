## Concepts : Pointers
 - *Task 1:* Modify an existing program to pass a variable to a function by reference using pointers, and explain the advantages of this approach. - Swap.c file
   
   - *Task 2:* Investigate and explain how pointers contribute to dynamic memory allocation and deallocation in programming.



## Concepts : Loop
   - *Task 1:* Write a program that employs a loop to find the factorial of a given number, and explain how the loop facilitates repetitive computation.

   - *Task 2:* Explore the concept of loop control statements (break and continue) and provide examples demonstrating their application in program flow.
