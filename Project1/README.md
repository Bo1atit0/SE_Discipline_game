# Implement the following operations using pointers and loops:
- Initialize: Initialize the array with random values.
- Display: Display the elements of the array.
- Sum: Calculate and display the sum of all elements in the array.
- Average: Calculate and display the average of all elements in the array.
- Reverse: Reverse the order of elements in the array and display the reversed array.
